### Example: Establish Facility Design and Layout for a Bakery

1. Separation of Raw and Ready-to-Eat Areas:

- Raw Ingredient Area: Designate a specific area for receiving and storing raw ingredients such as flour, eggs, butter, and sugar. These ingredients should be stored separately from finished products to prevent cross-contamination. For example, the raw ingredient storage should be on one side of the facility, away from areas where baked goods are cooled or packaged.
- Ready-to-Eat (RTE) Area: Finished baked products (e.g., bread, cakes, pastries) should have a designated preparation, cooling, and packaging area that is separate from the raw ingredient zones. Use physical barriers (e.g., walls or partitions) or distance to ensure that raw materials donâ€™t come into contact with finished products.

2. Equipment Layout:

- Zoning for Equipment: Place mixers, dough kneaders, and other equipment used for handling raw dough in the raw ingredient zone. Keep ovens in a separate area to minimize the movement of raw ingredients near cooling racks and packaging equipment.
- Flow of Materials and Workers: Ensure the workflow moves in one direction, from raw material handling to finished product handling, without overlapping paths. This helps reduce the risk of cross-contamination. Workers handling raw dough should not move directly to the RTE area without changing protective clothing and washing hands.
- Cleaning Stations: Set up designated cleaning stations in each zone. The cleaning station for the raw ingredient area should be used exclusively for cleaning utensils and equipment that come into contact with raw ingredients, while a separate station should be used for cleaning equipment from the RTE area.

3. Ventilation and Airflow:

- Ensure that the ventilation system is designed to prevent the spread of dust, flour, or bacteria from raw areas to finished product areas. Use a system that maintains positive air pressure in the RTE area so that air flows out of, rather than into, the clean zone, minimizing contamination.

4. Storage Design:

- Raw Ingredient Storage: Install shelving or racks to store raw materials off the ground, preventing moisture or contamination from the floor. Separate allergenic ingredients like nuts and flour from non-allergenic ingredients in clearly labeled, sealed containers.
- Finished Product Storage: Store finished baked goods in an area that is temperature-controlled and separate from raw materials. Use clearly marked containers or packaging to store finished products awaiting distribution or display.

5. Handwashing and Sanitation Stations:

- Install handwashing stations at the entrance and exit of each area to ensure that workers can easily wash their hands before transitioning between raw and ready-to-eat zones. Hand sanitizers, soap, and single-use towels should be readily available at each station.

6. Lighting and Accessibility:

- Ensure that the layout provides ample lighting in all work areas to facilitate visual inspections and cleaning. Surfaces and equipment should be easily accessible for thorough cleaning and maintenance, and the layout should allow space for workers to move comfortably while maintaining hygiene standards.

By designing the facility with these considerations in mind, the bakery can support good hygiene practices, reduce the risk of cross-contamination, and maintain compliance with food safety standards.
