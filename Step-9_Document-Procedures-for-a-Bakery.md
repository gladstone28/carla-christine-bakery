### Example: Document Procedures for a Bakery

1. Good Hygiene Practices (GHPs) Documentation:

- GHP Procedure Manual:

 - Create a comprehensive GHP manual that outlines the bakery’s hygiene standards, cleaning schedules, equipment maintenance procedures, and staff hygiene requirements.
 - Example: The manual specifies that all work surfaces must be cleaned and sanitized before starting each baking session, and floors must be swept and mopped at the end of each day. It includes step-by-step instructions for cleaning mixers, ovens, and cooling racks.

- Daily Cleaning Log:

 - Document daily cleaning activities in a log that tracks the date, time, and staff responsible for completing cleaning tasks.
 - Example: After each shift, staff must sign the cleaning log, confirming that equipment, work surfaces, and the production area have been cleaned. The log should note any areas that needed extra attention due to spills or contamination.

2. HACCP Plan Documentation:

- HACCP Plan Overview:
 - Develop a written HACCP plan that outlines critical control points (CCPs), critical limits, monitoring procedures, and corrective actions.
 - Example: The bakery’s HACCP plan identifies the baking process (temperature control) and allergen handling as CCPs. The plan specifies that cakes must be baked to an internal temperature of at least 70°C (158°F) and that allergen-containing products must be processed in a separate area.

3. Monitoring Records:

- Baking Temperature Log:

 - Keep a log for recording the internal temperatures of baked products. Each batch should be checked with a food thermometer to ensure it reaches the critical temperature.
 - Example: For each batch of cakes, the baker records the date, batch number, and final internal temperature in the log. If the cakes do not reach the required 70°C (158°F), a corrective action is triggered, such as extending the baking time.

- Cooling Time Log:

 - Record the time it takes for baked goods to cool from 60°C to 21°C within 2 hours and from 21°C to 5°C within 4 hours.
 - Example: A cooling log is maintained, where the staff member logs the cooling time and temperature for each batch to ensure proper cooling and prevent bacterial growth.

4. Corrective Action Logs:

- Deviation Reports:
 - Document any deviations from critical limits (e.g., baking temperatures not reaching 70°C, cooling taking too long) and the corrective actions taken.
 - Example: If a batch of cakes fails to reach 70°C during baking, the corrective action log will document the extension of baking time or the decision to discard the batch. The log includes the date, batch number, issue, corrective action taken, and staff signature.
- Allergen Cross-Contact Incident Log:
 - If cross-contact between allergens and non-allergenic products is detected, document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.
 - Example: The bakery logs incidents of cross-contact with allergens, including the products affected, how the issue was identified, the corrective cleaning measures taken, and actions to prevent future occurrences (e.g., retraining staff or revising cleaning protocols).

5. Verification Activities Documentation:

 - Internal Audit Reports:

 - Perform periodic internal audits to verify that GHPs and the HACCP plan are being followed correctly. Document the findings and corrective actions.
 - Example: Once a month, the bakery manager conducts an internal audit to verify that staff are following hygiene protocols and that monitoring records are complete. The audit report includes areas reviewed (e.g., cleaning logs, baking temperature records), issues found, and corrective actions taken.

- Thermometer Calibration Log:

 - Record the calibration of thermometers used for monitoring baking and cooling temperatures. This ensures that the equipment is providing accurate readings.
 - Example: The bakery calibrates its thermometers weekly, documenting the date of calibration, results, and any adjustments made. If a thermometer is found to be inaccurate, it is repaired or replaced, and the action is logged.

6. Staff Training Records:

 - Training Logs:
  - Document all staff training on food safety, hygiene practices, allergen management, and HACCP procedures. Keep records of the topics covered, the date of training, and the attendees.
  - Example: After every training session, the bakery maintains a log detailing the names of the participants, the subject of the training (e.g., proper handwashing techniques, handling allergens), and the name of the trainer. Any additional assessments or certifications are also recorded.

7. Product Recall Documentation:

- Recall Procedures:
  - Keep a documented plan for product recalls, including step-by-step instructions on how to trace and remove affected products from the market.
  - Example: If a batch of cakes is found to have an issue that could pose a health risk (e.g., contamination or undeclared allergens), the bakery’s recall procedure is activated. The recall report includes details on how the products were traced, which stores or customers received the affected products, and the steps taken to communicate the recall.

8. Supplier Verification Records:

 - Supplier Audits and Ingredient Traceability:
  - Document the bakery’s efforts to verify that ingredients from suppliers meet food safety and quality standards.
  - Example: The bakery maintains records of its ingredient suppliers, including certifications, audits, and any tests performed to ensure ingredients like flour and eggs meet safety standards. Each delivery is logged with a date, batch number, and inspection results.

By creating and maintaining these records, the bakery ensures traceability, accountability, and compliance with food safety standards, making it easier to identify and address any food safety issues that arise. These documents also serve as proof of compliance with regulatory requirements during inspections.
