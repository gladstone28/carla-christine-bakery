### Example: Maintain Equipment in a Bakery

1. Regular Cleaning Schedule:

 - Daily cleaning: After every use, all equipment that comes into contact with food, such as mixers, dough sheeters, and ovens, must be cleaned and sanitized. Staff follow a written cleaning procedure that includes disassembling equipment where necessary (e.g., removing mixing paddles), washing with food-safe detergent, and rinsing with hot water.

  - Example: At the end of each shift, staff clean the industrial mixers by scrubbing the bowl, paddles, and attachments, then rinsing and sanitizing them with a food-grade disinfectant. The equipment is air-dried before being reassembled.
 - Weekly deep cleaning: Once a week, perform a more thorough cleaning of all equipment, including areas not usually accessible during daily cleaning (e.g., behind ovens or under counters). This includes degreasing and removing any buildup of food particles or debris.

  - Example: Each Friday, the bakery staff conduct a deep clean, pulling out equipment like the dough mixer to clean underneath it, checking for grease buildup on moving parts, and sanitizing any hard-to-reach areas.

2. Routine Maintenance:

  - Preventive maintenance schedule: Create a schedule for routine maintenance of equipment such as ovens, refrigerators, and mixers. This includes inspecting for wear and tear, checking electrical connections, and lubricating moving parts to prevent breakdowns or contamination risks (e.g., from broken parts).

   - Example: Every month, the bakery contracts a technician to check and service the ovens. They inspect the heating elements, clean out vents, and verify that the temperature controls are functioning correctly.
- Inspection for wear and damage: Staff are trained to regularly inspect equipment during use for signs of wear or damage (e.g., cracked plastic parts, worn mixer paddles, loose bolts). Any signs of potential contamination risks, such as flaking metal or plastic, are reported immediately for repair or replacement.

  - Example: During routine use, a baker notices that a mixer paddle has a small crack. The staff member stops using the mixer, logs the issue, and notifies the manager to arrange for a replacement.

3. Equipment Calibration:

 - Temperature calibration: Ovens and refrigerators must be calibrated regularly to ensure that they maintain the proper temperatures for food safety. Thermometers are used to check that ovens heat to the required temperature and that refrigerators keep perishable ingredients below 5°C (41°F).

  - Example: The bakery manager calibrates the ovens once a month by using a digital thermometer to ensure the baking temperature matches the oven settings. If the temperature is off, the oven is adjusted or repaired.
 - Thermometer calibration: All thermometers used in the bakery (e.g., for checking baking temperatures and food storage temperatures) are calibrated regularly to ensure accurate readings.

   - Example: Every two weeks, the bakery manager checks the accuracy of food thermometers by placing them in boiling water (100°C) and cold water (0°C) and adjusting or replacing any thermometers that are not accurate.

4. Monitoring and Record-Keeping:

  - Equipment maintenance log: Keep a detailed log of all equipment cleaning, maintenance, and repairs. This includes the date, the type of service performed (cleaning, maintenance, calibration), and the staff member responsible.

   - Example: After each cleaning or maintenance task, staff record the completion in the equipment maintenance log. If repairs or parts replacements were needed (e.g., fixing a broken mixing blade), the details are documented, including the date, service provider, and the issue fixed.
 - Repair records: If a piece of equipment malfunctions, record the nature of the malfunction, how it was resolved, and any changes made to prevent future problems. Keep receipts or documentation for major repairs or replacements.

  - Example: When the refrigerator malfunctions and cannot maintain a temperature below 5°C, a technician is called to replace the compressor. The repair is logged, and the invoice is attached to the record for future reference.

5. Emergency Breakdown Procedures:

  - Contingency plan for breakdowns: Develop a plan for what to do if critical equipment breaks down during production (e.g., an oven stops working mid-bake or the refrigerator fails). This plan includes procedures for safely handling affected food and contacting repair services.
   - Example: If an oven breaks down while cakes are baking, the bakery has a plan to move unfinished batches to a working oven. Staff monitor the temperature closely to ensure the food is still cooked to the correct temperature, or they discard the affected batch if it cannot be salvaged.

6. Sanitizing Utensils and Small Equipment:

  - Utensil cleaning: All small equipment, like spatulas, whisks, and knives, must be washed with hot, soapy water and sanitized after each use, especially when switching between raw ingredients and baked products.
   - Example: After mixing raw egg-based dough, staff wash all utensils in hot water with detergent and then sanitize them with a food-safe solution before using them to handle cooked products.

By maintaining equipment through regular cleaning, servicing, and monitoring, the bakery can minimize the risk of food contamination, equipment breakdowns, and ensure that all tools and machines operate effectively for safe food production. Keeping thorough records of all maintenance and repairs also supports traceability and compliance with food safety regulations.
