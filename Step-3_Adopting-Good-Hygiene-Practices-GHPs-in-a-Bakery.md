### Example of Step 3: Adopting Good Hygiene Practices (GHPs) in a Bakery

1. Personal Hygiene:

- Handwashing: Bakery staff must wash their hands regularly, especially after handling raw ingredients like flour, eggs, and dough. Place handwashing stations in convenient locations with soap and paper towels.
- Protective clothing: Staff should wear clean uniforms, aprons, hairnets, and, if necessary, gloves to prevent hair or other contaminants from falling into the dough or finished products.
- Health policy: Staff should report any symptoms of illness, especially gastrointestinal issues, and be restricted from food handling if they are unwell.

2. Facility Cleanliness:

- Daily cleaning routine: Clean and sanitize all baking surfaces, mixers, and utensils after each use to prevent contamination. Sweep and mop floors daily to prevent buildup of flour dust and other debris.
- Pest control: Ensure that flour and other ingredients are stored in tightly sealed containers to avoid attracting pests like rodents or insects. Regularly check for any signs of pests and use pest control services if needed.
- Waste disposal: Dispose of food waste and packaging material in sealed containers, ensuring they are emptied frequently to maintain cleanliness.

3. Separation of Raw and Finished Products:

- Storage: Store raw materials (e.g., flour, eggs, and butter) separately from finished baked goods. Use separate shelving in refrigerators and storage areas for raw and finished products to avoid cross-contamination.
- Preparation areas: Use designated areas and utensils for mixing raw dough and handling baked products. Clean thoroughly between handling raw ingredients and finished goods to avoid cross-contact.
- Avoid cross-contamination: For products containing allergens (like nuts or dairy), have separate preparation areas or tools to prevent cross-contact with other baked goods.

4. Temperature Control:

- Ingredient storage: Keep perishable ingredients like butter, milk, and eggs at or below 5°C (41°F) in the refrigerator. Ensure that freezers and refrigerators are regularly checked for proper temperature.
- Baking temperatures: Ensure that all products, especially those containing eggs, are baked to the proper internal temperature to kill harmful bacteria. Use a thermometer if needed.
- Cooling: Once baked, products should cool in a clean area with good ventilation to avoid bacterial growth. Do not leave baked goods at room temperature for extended periods.

5. Use of Safe Water and Ingredients:

- Water quality: Ensure that water used for baking, cleaning, and steam generation is clean and safe.
- Ingredient sourcing: Use fresh, high-quality ingredients from trusted suppliers. Check deliveries for damage or signs of spoilage and store them appropriately upon arrival.

By implementing these GHPs in the bakery, you can maintain a clean and hygienic environment, minimize contamination risks, and ensure the safety and quality of your baked products.
