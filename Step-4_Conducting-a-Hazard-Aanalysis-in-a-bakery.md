### Example of Step 4: Conducting a Hazard Analysis in a Bakery

1. Identify Potential Biological Hazards:

- Raw eggs in products: Raw eggs can carry Salmonella, a harmful bacteria. This is a risk in items like cakes, pastries, or fillings that use raw eggs.
- Flour contamination: Raw flour may contain pathogens such as E. coli, which can be transferred to ready-to-eat products if not properly baked.
- Cross-contamination: Improper handling or cleaning can lead to cross-contamination between raw ingredients (e.g., raw dough) and finished products.

2. Identify Potential Chemical Hazards:

- Cleaning agents: Residual cleaning chemicals on surfaces or equipment can contaminate food if not properly rinsed off.
- Food allergens: Common allergens like wheat, dairy, nuts, or soy present a risk if cross-contact occurs between products or during the handling of ingredients.

3. Identify Potential Physical Hazards:

- Foreign objects: Pieces of packaging materials, hair, or broken equipment parts could accidentally end up in food products.
- Improper use of equipment: Damaged equipment like broken mixers or slicers could introduce physical hazards such as metal fragments.

4. Evaluate the Likelihood and Severity of Hazards:

- Biological hazards: Raw egg products have a higher likelihood of carrying Salmonella if not cooked thoroughly. The severity is high because foodborne illness can result in serious harm to consumers.
- Chemical hazards: The likelihood of chemical contamination from improper cleaning is moderate, but the severity is high, especially for allergen cross-contact, which can cause severe allergic reactions.
- Physical hazards: The likelihood of foreign objects entering food is low but still possible. The severity can be moderate, depending on the type of foreign object (e.g., small plastic fragments vs. sharp metal pieces).

5. Control Measures for Identified Hazards:

- Biological control: Ensure that products containing eggs are baked to a safe internal temperature, and that raw flour is handled safely. Implement strict cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contamination between raw and baked goods.
- Chemical control: Use food-safe cleaning agents, follow proper cleaning procedures, and store cleaning supplies away from food areas. Implement allergen management practices, such as using separate tools and areas for allergenic products.
- Physical control: Regularly inspect and maintain equipment to prevent foreign objects from entering food products. Implement strict protocols for handling and storage of packaging materials.

6. Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs):

- For a bakery, critical control points may include:
  - Baking temperature and time: Ensure products like cakes and pastries containing raw eggs are baked to an internal temperature of at least 70°C (158°F) to kill Salmonella.
  - Cleaning of allergen-handling equipment: Implement strict cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contact with allergens.
  - Final product inspection: Regularly check for any foreign objects before packaging and shipping.

By conducting this hazard analysis, the bakery can identify where hazards are most likely to occur and establish control measures to prevent them, ensuring the safety and quality of the food products.
