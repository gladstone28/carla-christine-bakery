### Example of Step 6: Monitoring and Verifying Controls in a Bakery

1. Critical Control Point (CCP) 1: Baking Temperature Monitoring:

- Monitoring procedure: During the baking process, the bakery staff will use a food thermometer to check that the internal temperature of the cakes reaches at least 70°C (158°F) to eliminate harmful bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli.
- Frequency: For every batch of cakes, a staff member will measure and record the internal temperature of at least one cake per oven load.
- Record-keeping: The temperature will be logged on a baking temperature sheet with the date, time, and initials of the staff member who performed the check.

Verification:

- Weekly calibration of thermometers: The bakery manager will check the accuracy of all thermometers weekly and recalibrate if necessary to ensure they are giving correct readings.
- Monthly review of records: The bakery manager will review the baking temperature logs once a month to verify that cakes consistently reach the required temperature. If discrepancies are found, corrective actions will be reviewed and improved.

2. Critical Control Point (CCP) 2: Cooling Process Monitoring:

- Monitoring procedure: After baking, cakes will be cooled from 60°C to 21°C within 2 hours and from 21°C to 5°C within the next 4 hours to prevent bacterial growth. A temperature probe will be used to monitor the cooling process.
- Frequency: Staff will check and log the temperature of cakes at the 2-hour and 6-hour marks during cooling.
- Record-keeping: Cooling logs will be maintained, recording the time, temperature, and staff initials.

Verification:

- Weekly check of cooling logs: The bakery manager will review cooling logs each week to ensure compliance with cooling time and temperature requirements.
- Random spot checks: The bakery manager will occasionally perform spot checks by measuring cooling temperatures at random times to ensure that staff are following the procedure.

3. Critical Control Point (CCP) 3: Allergen Control Monitoring:

- Monitoring procedure: Separate utensils and equipment will be used when handling allergenic ingredients like nuts. After handling allergenic products, equipment and surfaces will be cleaned and sanitized.
- Frequency: Staff will clean all surfaces and utensils after preparing allergen-containing products, and inspections will be conducted before switching to non-allergenic products.
- Record-keeping: Allergen management logs will document the cleaning process, including the time, date, and staff initials.

Verification:

- Weekly inspection: The bakery manager will inspect cleaning records weekly and perform a visual check to ensure thorough cleaning after handling allergens.
- Allergen residue testing: Monthly swab tests will be conducted on cleaned surfaces to verify the effectiveness of allergen cleaning practices.

4. Overall Control Monitoring and Record Verification:

- Daily monitoring: Staff will conduct and log the necessary checks for baking temperature, cooling, and allergen control daily.
- Corrective actions: If a deviation occurs (e.g., a cake doesn’t reach 70°C or cooling takes too long), the corrective action will be documented, and the affected product will be handled as per the established procedures (e.g., further baking or discarding the product).
- Record-keeping: All logs (baking temperature, cooling, allergen control) will be kept and reviewed periodically to ensure compliance.

Verification:

- Internal audits: The bakery manager will conduct an internal audit every quarter to review all records, monitoring procedures, and corrective actions to ensure compliance with the HACCP plan.
- Annual HACCP review: The entire HACCP plan will be reviewed and updated annually to reflect any changes in processes, equipment, or products.

By systematically monitoring these critical control points and verifying that all controls are working as intended, the bakery can ensure that hazards are effectively controlled and that the food products are safe for consumption.
