The document "General Principles of Food Hygiene" outlines essential guidelines for ensuring the safety and suitability of food across the food chain. It emphasizes the importance of Good Hygiene Practices (GHPs) and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system in preventing foodborne illnesses, contamination, and food spoilage. These principles apply to all stages of food production, from primary production to consumption. The document aims to assist food business operators and competent authorities in implementing effective food safety measures, enhancing consumer protection, and supporting international trade.
