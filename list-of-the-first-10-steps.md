**To implement the "General Principles of Food Hygiene" standard in your food business, here are the first 10 steps you should take:**

1. **Commit to Food Safety Culture:** Ensure that management and all personnel are committed to producing and handling safe food by fostering a positive food safety culture.

2. **Understand Hazards:** Identify potential biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with your food products, production processes, and environment.

3. **Adopt Good Hygiene Practices (GHPs):** Implement GHPs, including maintaining cleanliness, controlling contamination, and ensuring food handler hygiene.

4. **Conduct a Hazard Analysis:** Perform a hazard analysis to identify any significant hazards and determine if GHPs alone are sufficient or if additional control measures are needed.

5. **Develop a HACCP Plan:** If hazards cannot be controlled by GHPs alone, develop a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan to control these hazards.

6. **Monitor and Verify Controls:** Implement monitoring systems to track GHP and HACCP procedures. Ensure that controls are working effectively, and corrective actions are taken when deviations occur.

7. **Establish Facility Design and Layout:** Ensure your facility is designed and structured to support good hygiene and minimize cross-contamination (e.g., proper separation of raw and ready-to-eat areas).

8. **Train Personnel:** Provide regular food hygiene training to all staff, ensuring they understand their roles in maintaining food safety.

9. **Document Procedures:** Create clear documentation of your GHPs and HACCP plans, including monitoring records, corrective actions, and verification activities.

10. **Maintain Equipment:** Ensure that all equipment is regularly cleaned, maintained, and monitored for food safety risks to prevent contamination.
