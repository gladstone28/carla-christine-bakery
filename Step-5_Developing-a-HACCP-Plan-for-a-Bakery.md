### Example of Step 5: Developing a HACCP Plan for a Bakery

1. Assemble a HACCP Team:

- Form a team that includes the bakery manager, head baker, and quality control staff. If needed, include external experts such as food safety consultants.

2. Describe the Product:

- Product: Chocolate cake made with raw eggs, flour, sugar, butter, and milk.
- Intended use: Ready-to-eat after baking and cooling.
- Consumers: General public, including potential at-risk groups such as children and elderly.

3. Create a Process Flow Diagram:

- Steps:
  - Receiving raw materials (flour, eggs, butter, sugar)
  - Mixing ingredients
  - Baking
  - Cooling
  - Packaging
  - Storage
  - Distribution

4. Identify Critical Control Points (CCPs):

- Baking: The baking process is a critical control point because it eliminates harmful bacteria (e.g., Salmonella from eggs and E. coli from flour).
- Cooling: Ensure rapid cooling to prevent the growth of bacteria. Temperature control during cooling is essential.
- Allergen management: Allergen control is a critical point during the mixing and packaging process to prevent cross-contact with allergenic ingredients like nuts (if other products contain nuts).

5. Set Critical Limits for Each CCP:

- Baking: Internal temperature of the cake must reach at least 70°C (158°F) for 2 minutes to kill harmful bacteria.
- Cooling: Cool cakes from 60°C to 21°C within 2 hours, and from 21°C to 5°C within the next 4 hours to prevent bacterial growth.
- Allergen management: Use separate utensils and equipment for products containing allergens (e.g., nuts). Clean and sanitize all surfaces between handling products with and without allergens.

6. Establish Monitoring Procedures:

- Baking: Use a food thermometer to check that the internal temperature of cakes reaches 70°C (158°F) during every baking batch.
- Cooling: Monitor cooling times and temperatures with a temperature probe and log the results.
- Allergen management: Inspect equipment and utensils for cleanliness before and after preparing allergenic products. Verify that labels accurately identify allergens.

7. Establish Corrective Actions:

- Baking: If the internal temperature does not reach 70°C (158°F), extend the baking time and recheck. Discard any cake that cannot be safely brought to the required temperature.
- Cooling: If the cooling process exceeds the allowed time, discard the cakes to prevent bacterial growth.
- Allergen management: If cross-contact with allergens occurs, discard the affected batch and re-clean the equipment.

8. Establish Verification Procedures:

- Baking: Regularly calibrate thermometers to ensure accurate temperature readings.
- Cooling: Perform regular audits of cooling logs to verify compliance with time and temperature requirements.
- Allergen management: Conduct periodic testing for allergen residues on cleaned surfaces to ensure thorough cleaning.

9. Establish Record-Keeping and Documentation:

- Keep records of baking temperatures, cooling times, allergen checks, and corrective actions taken. This will help demonstrate compliance with food safety regulations and provide traceability in case of a food safety incident.

10. Review the HACCP Plan Regularly:

- Review the HACCP plan whenever there are changes in ingredients, equipment, or processes (e.g., new baking techniques, changes in suppliers). Conduct annual reviews to ensure the plan remains effective.

By developing and implementing this HACCP plan, the bakery can systematically control food safety risks, ensuring that products are safe for consumption and preventing hazards such as bacterial contamination and allergen cross-contact.
