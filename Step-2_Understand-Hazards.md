**Here’s an example of how to address Step 2: Understand Hazards for a food business, specifically a bakery:**

### Example of Step 2: Understanding Hazards in a Bakery

1. Biological Hazards:

- Contamination from raw ingredients: Flour, eggs, and milk can introduce harmful bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli.
- Cross-contamination: Raw ingredients (like raw eggs) can contaminate ready-to-eat baked goods if proper hygiene is not followed.
- Improper cooking temperatures: Not baking products like bread and cakes to the correct temperature can allow harmful bacteria to survive.

2. Chemical Hazards:

- Cleaning chemicals: Residues from cleaning agents used on baking surfaces or equipment can contaminate the food.
- Food additives: If food additives like preservatives are misused or used beyond their safe limits, they can pose health risks to consumers.

3. Physical Hazards:

- Foreign objects: Items like glass, metal fragments from broken equipment, or plastic bits from packaging materials can accidentally get into baked products.
- Employee hygiene issues: Hair, fingernails, or jewelry may accidentally fall into food during the preparation process.

### Actions:

- Train staff on proper handling of raw ingredients to avoid biological contamination.
- Implement strict cleaning schedules and procedures to ensure chemicals don’t come into contact with food.
- Regularly inspect equipment for damage and replace any broken parts that could pose physical contamination risks.

By identifying and understanding these hazards, you can implement the right controls, such as cooking food to the correct temperature or using separate areas for raw and ready-to-eat products, to ensure food safety.
